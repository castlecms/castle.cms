Running tests
=============

*Default plone testing:*

*To run only robot tests:*

.. code-block:: shell

  ./bin/test -s castle.cms -t robot


*Without robot:*

.. code-block:: shell

If you have errors complaining about warning, make sure the version of selenium
you're using works with the version of Firefox you have installed (see above)


Running local dependencies with docker
--------------------------------------

    $ docker-compose up

    or, just the essentials:
    $ docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
    $ docker run -p 9200:9200 elasticsearch:2.4-alpine


Forks/Custom releases
---------------------

Castle maintains forks and custom releases of packages occasionally. Here is the
status and reasoning for our forks:

- plone.app.blocks: https://github.com/castlecms/plone.app.blocks
  (Hard fork): Castle heavily customizes how Plone renders things including how "blocks" are rendered
- plone-app-mosaic: https://github.com/castlecms/plone.app.mosaic/tree/castlecms
  (Hard fork, castlecms branch): Originally for fixes but at this point, we will maintain the fork
  until we have reason not to or we have better alternative layout engines.
- plonetheme.barceloneta:
  (Hard fork): Castle rendering of barceloneta. No Diazo.
- plone.app.registry
  (Dev release): Release to get Plone 5.1 features into Castle based off Plone 5.0.
  Can be removed once we go to 5.2
- plone.app.standardtiles
  (Dev release): Unknown status on if we still need this release.
- Products.ZCatalog
  (Dev release): unknown status
- z3c.relationfield
  (Dev release): PR: https://github.com/zopefoundation/z3c.relationfield/pull/7
- mockup: https://github.com/plone/mockup/tree/2.4.x
  (Dev release): TinyMCE backport fixes from 5.1
- Products-CMFPlone
  (Dev release): TinyMCE backport fixes from 5.1 and bundle ordering bug: https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/pull/2632
