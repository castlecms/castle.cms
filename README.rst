Installation
============

This package includes a lot of customizations to default Plone and, without an installer,
getting it running is a bit tricky.

Dependencies
------------

- Redis
- avconv (needs to be updated for ffmpeg again)
- ElasticSearch 2.3


Development setup on macOS
--------------------------

1. ``brew install redis elasticsearch libav python``
2. ``git clone git@github.com:castlecms/castle.cms.git``
3. ``cd castle.cms``
4. ``virtualenv -p python2.7 .``
5. ``bin/pip install --upgrade pip``
6. ``bin/pip install -r requirements.txt``
7. ``bin/buildout``
8. Run (in separate terminal windows) ``elasticsearch``, ``redis-server``, ``bin/instance fg`` and ``bin/celery worker``
9. Browse to http://localhost:8080/


Optional Dependencies
---------------------

- Install `argon2_cffi` to use more secure password hashing.
- https://github.com/castlecms/elasticsearch-castle-scoring
- https://github.com/castlecms/castlehps for faster search integration
- Amazon S3 credentials to store large files on S3
- Google API keys for Google analytics and Recaptcha integrations
- Plivo API for SMS


Running tests
=============

Assuming you have buildout properly installed to run the tests:

.. code-block:: shell

    Xvfb :99 &
    Xvfb :99 -fp /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc -screen 0 1900x1900x24 &
    export DISPLAY=:99

To access the running Selenium test server on port 55001:

.. code-block:: shell

    ZSERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/test -s castle.cms

To specify a custom Firefox binary to match versions:

.. code-block:: shell

    FIREFOX_BINARY=/opt/firefox/firefox ./bin/test  -s castle.cms

If Selenium refuses to start, update the binaries:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -U selenium

If it still doesn't run, attempt to install Firefox 45
`<https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/45.0/linux-x86_64/en-US/>`_

Non-Selenium tests:

Since Selenium can be flaky...

.. code-block:: shell

  ./bin/test -s castle.cms -t \!selenium


Google Analytics Key File
-------------------------

- go to the Google API console
- create new credentials
  - service account
  - p12
- enable Analytics API api for credentials
- fill out email with email provided and p12 file in CastleCMS API settings
- use email for email you want to access and add it as an authorized user for the account in Google Analytics

Export/Import
-------------

CastleCMS provides a simple export/import mechanism that does not use transmogrifier.

You are still able to build your own custom transmogrifier pipelines to import/export
into CastleCMS; however, our scripts work in a lot of cases to get your
content moved over quickly.


Export
~~~~~~

Copy the export script into your existing site's main buildout folder::

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castlecms/castle.cms/master/castle/cms/_scripts/export-content.py

Then, to run the export script::

  ./bin/client1 run export-content.py --site-id=mysiteid --dir=./export

where "client1" is a ZEO client of your site and "mysiteid" is the
ID of your Plone site.

To customize the export script so only parts of the site are exported,
you can change the final line in the script to a custom catalog query that 
pulls in only the content you want to export.


Import
~~~~~~

Start by copying the exported directory (that you created in the previous step) to
the CastleCMS installation folder.

Next, copy the import script into your new CastleCMS site's main buildout folder::

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castlecms/castle.cms/master/castle/cms/_scripts/importjson.py

Then, to run the import script::

  ./bin/client1 run importjson.py --site-id=mysiteid --export-directory=./export

where "client1" is a ZEO client of your site and "mysiteid" is the
ID of your CastleCMS site.


To register your own import type, using Event as an example::

    from castle.cms._scripts.importtypes import BaseImportType
    from castle.cms._scripts.importtypes import register_import_type
    from castle.cms._scripts.importtypes import DateTime_to_datetime

    class MyImportType(BaseImportType):
        fields_mapping = {
            # list of original field names to new field names
            # 'startDate': 'start'
        }
        data_converters = {
            # field name -> func(val) -> val
            # convert data to the format it should be
            # 'start': DateTime_to_datetime,
        }
        behavior_data_mappers = (
            # (Behavior Interface, field name)
            # to set behavior data from export data...
            # (IEventBasic, 'start'),
        )

        def post_creation(self, obj):
            '''
            Additional custom data migration after object is created
            ''''
            super(MyType, self).post_creation(obj)
            obj.foo = 'bar'

    register_import_type('MyType', MyImportType)



Tile display types
------------------

There are tiles provided by CastleCMS that allow you to customize
the display type. The display type field is a way of providing a different
view of the content.

Available display type tiles include the following (along with the matching display type vocabulary ID):

 - Navigation (navigation)
 - Existing content (existing)
 - Gallery (gallery)
 - Query Listing (querylisting)


Providing your own display types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 3 components to registering a display type for a tile:
  - Display type class
  - Page template
  - ZCML registration

Example custom display type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example of creating a custom display type for the existing content tile.

Define the display type class::

    class MyTileView(BaseTileView):
        name = 'myview'
        preview = '++plone++castle/path/to/image.png'
        order = 1
        index = ViewPageTemplateFile('myview.pt')
        tile_name = 'existing'


Then define the template::

    <tal:wrap tal:define="utils view/tile/utils;
                          data view/tile/data;
                          df view/tile/display_fields;
                          idt data/image_display_type|string:landscape;
                          existing nocall: view/tile/content|nothing;
                          url python: utils.get_object_url(existing);
                          has_image python: 'image' in df and utils.has_image(existing);">
     <h3><a href="${url}">${existing/Title}</a></h3>
    </tal:wrap>


Finally, define the ZCML to register it::

    <adapter
      name="existing.myview"
      provides="castle.cms.interfaces.ITileView"
      for="plone.dexterity.interfaces.IDexterityContent castle.cms.interfaces.ICastleLayer"
      factory=".myview.MyTileView"
      />



Lead images
-----------

- all content has lead images
- lead images can be references to other images on the site or to other content on the site that has a lead image



CastleCMS upgrades
-------------------

There is currently no UI in the Site Setup to run CastleCMS
upgrades.

To run upgrades::

  - go to the Management Interface (/manage) for your site
  - click on portal_setup
  - click the "Upgrades" tab
  - select "castle.cms:default" and click "choose profile"
  - from here, you should get a list of available upgrades to run


After the Deadline Spellchecking
--------------------------------

CastleCMS includes Plone's TinyMCE support for After the Deadline spellchecking and::

  - supports After the Deadline in rich text tiles
  - integrates spelling/grammar check within the content quality check dialog

To use After the Deadline, go to Site Setup and configure After the Deadline in the
TinyMCE configuration panel.
